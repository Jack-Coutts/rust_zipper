# Zipping CLI

## How to download the program

* Download the program for Windows machines [here](https://github.com/Jack-Coutts/rust_zipper/releases/latest/download/windows_rust_zipper.exe.zip).
* Download the program for Mac machines [here](https://github.com/Jack-Coutts/rust_zipper/releases/latest/download/mac_rust_zipper.zip).

You will need to unzip the downloaded file and move it to a suitable folder. 

## How to run the script

1. To run the script you simply need to double click on the the mac or windows rust_zipper file that you have downloaded. You may be warned that the file is unsafe and in this case you might need to right click on the file and then click open instead.
2. Once the program is running the terminal or command prompt will open and you will be asked to input the path to your target directory. Input this as instructed by the program.
3. By default, the program will zip all folders within your target directory but not files. You will be asked whether you also want the files to be zipped and you must answer 'yes' or 'no'.
4. After answering these questions the script will run and the files will be zipped. The progress will be printed to the screen and you will be told when the process has finished.


The program will zip all folders in the target directory (and optionally the files) and place them in a folder called zipped.
